[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kelseyhightower/confd.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kelseyhightower/confd)

`confd` is a lightweight configuration management tool focused on:

* keeping local configuration files up-to-date by polling [etcd](https://github.com/coreos/etcd) or
  [Consul](http://consul.io) and processing [template resources](docs/template-resources.md).
* reloading applications to pick up new config file changes

# Current Stable Version: 0.6.1

The current stable version of confd is 0.6.1. The previous version is being maintained on the 0.5.x branch. The docs for the 0.5.x version can be found [here](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/confd/tree/0.5.x/docs).

confd 0.6.1 is a big change from 0.5.x, see the 0.6.1 [release notes](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/confd/releases/tag/v0.6.1) for more details.
